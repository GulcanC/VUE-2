## About the Project
This is my personal VUE.js project. After I had learned some new topics about Vue.js with the course project ‚ÄúMonster Slayer Game‚Äù, I decided to prepare a slightly more advanced project like this one. 
There are some options for fighting against pirate, there is a battle log where we can see what happened. 

With this project I practiced with:
data binding,
interpolation,
v-bind,
event binding with v-on,
output lists of data with v-for,
conditional content with v-if, v-else
